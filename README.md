# Introduction to Batch Processing

## DE Zoomcamp 5.1.1 - Batch vs Streaming

Batch processing: processing chunks of data at regular intervals.
Example: processing taxi trips each month.
A batch job can be scheduled in many ways: (Weekly, Daily, Hourly)

Streaming: processing data on the fly.
Example: processing a taxi trip as soon as it's generated.

#### Pros and cons of batch jobs
<li>Advantages:</li>
Easy to manage. There are multiple tools to manage them (the technologies we already mentioned)
Re-executable. Jobs can be easily retried if they fail.
Scalable. Scripts can be executed in more capable machines; Spark can be run in bigger clusters, etc.
<li>Disadvantages:</li>
Delay. Each task of the workflow in the previous section may take a few minutes; assuming the whole workflow takes 20 minutes, we would need to wait those 20 minutes until the data is ready for work.

## Introduction to Spark
Spark is an open-source, distributed computation engine that:

<li> Distributes workloads: Splits data across multiple machines/nodes, enabling parallel processing and faster analysis.</li>
<li> Handles diverse data: Works with various data formats, from structured databases to unstructured text files.</li>
<li> Offers multiple languages: Can be programmed with Scala, Java, Python, R, or SQL.</li>
Supports multiple use cases: Tackle batch processing, real-time streaming, machine learning, and more.
In this module, we will be using PySpark, a Python API for Apache Spark. It enables you to perform real-time, large-scale data processing in a distributed environment using Python. PySpark supports all of Sparkâ€™s features such as Spark SQL, DataFrames, Structured Streaming, Machine Learning (MLlib), and Spark Core.
The wrapper for Python is called PySpark.

Spark can deal with both batches and streaming data. The technique for streaming data is seeing a stream of data as a sequence of small batches and then applying similar techniques on them to those used on regular badges. We will cover streaming in detail in the next lesson.
